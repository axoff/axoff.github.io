                    <p>This album cover was designed as a re-release vinyl for Porter Robinsonâ€™s Worlds
                        album. Included in the release was a limited edition jacket and double-sided
                        vinyl. I chose a minimal design with the custom logo and mountain effect cutting
                        through the noise of the background with clean fills. The colors chosen reflect
                        the lighthearted sounds of the included album.</p>

                        brand. We were tasked with using 3 varying styles or categories of eyewear, and present
                        the catalogue with a unique diecut. I used a repeating eye pattern for my cover to create
                        visual stimulation and presented the eyewear as a product-focused spread with few distractions.</p>

                    <p>The National Audubon Society magazine ad campaign was focused to a younger audience
                        who are generally unaware of the National Audubon Society and their efforts. I created
                        a Twitter campaign to increase visibility and engage the audience to take action and
                        participate in the event. We communicated this campaign through picture window, silhouettes,
                        and Mondrian layouts.</p>

                    <p>MEGA Skateboards is a fictional skate brand aimed at risk-takers and casual street skaters.
                        The goal for this project was to create a cohesive brand image for the launch of a new
                        skateboarding company. I designed the boards and ads with a simple red, black, and white
                        color palette to set focus on specific elements of the boards and campaign.</p>
